# RokuTyper for Windows

Simple little GUI for previous RokuTyper program I made, but this time it works with Windows.

To run, install the requirements.txt, then press WinTyper.pyw. The program will load and you can press Find Roku to begin the scan or type in the IP address of a known Roku that is already on your network.

Please only use this on authorized Rokus and on authroized networks.
